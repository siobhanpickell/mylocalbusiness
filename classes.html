          <h1 class="title1">AKASHIC REIKI</h1>
          <h2 class="text1">
            Receive Akashic and Reiki healing energy as you are guided through a meditation that helps you release and relax into a state of deep peace. Reiki is universal life force energy that has been shown to relieve depression, anxiety, insomnia, pain, and more. When one receives Reiki their brain moves into an alpha state of deep relaxation. Akashic energy carries unconditional love, wisdom, and assistance from our guides, angels, and source, or from that which we equate those energies to. It opens us to the “all possible” and the paradoxical nature of the oneness, which in turn expands our consciousness. You can have any belief system to receive these healing energies and you do not need to have any previous meditation experience. Relax, release, and receive during this weekly class.

          <h1 class="title2">ANCESTRAL HEALING</h1>
          <h2 class="text2">
            Ancestral healing amounts to healing your ancestors from any trauma, unresolved emotional issues, or health problems that they may have passed over from their lifetime here on Earth. This benefits them, us, and all our descendants. There are many, many benefits to ancestral healing, but the most special part is being able to witness breaking of patterns, belief systems that aren’t ours to carry. Ancestral Healing is a necessary tool in our Mediumship Toolbox.
